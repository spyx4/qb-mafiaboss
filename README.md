📜 Mafia Boss Missions – QBCore

This script adds dynamic Mafia-style missions to your FiveM QBCore server. Players can interact with a Mafia Boss NPC to receive one of three random missions:

🔥 Burn Mission

The player is tasked with burning down a marked building.

A realistic animation plays while pouring gasoline.

The building catches fire.

Once done, the player must return to the Mafia Boss to complete the mission.

🚗 Steal Vehicle Mission

The player must locate and steal a Mafia-marked vehicle guarded by NPCs.

Guards are aggressive and will attack the player.

After stealing the vehicle, the player must deliver it to a random drop-off point.

Once delivered, they return to the Mafia Boss for their reward.

🔫 Kill Mission

The player is assigned to eliminate a target NPC at a random location.

The target is armed and will fight back.

If the player kills the target and survives, the mission is marked as complete.

If the player dies, they can be revived and still claim the reward if the target was killed.
